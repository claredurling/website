_Tim Vinall (Head of Music at Herne Bay High School)_

> It has been my pleasure to work with Clare for some fifteen years.  We first met when she came to Dane Court Grammar School, in Broadstairs, Kent, as our singing teacher.  She was always thoroughly professional in her role and provided excellent tuition for our students, many of whom are still utilising what they learned, to this day.
> 
> Now, in the very different environment of Herne Bay High School (also in Kent), she continues to cater for the needs of all our vocal students.  Her ability to train voices either in the classical or pop tradition is a real boon.  It is rare to find a vocal coach who can so effortlessly and competently move between such different styles and techniques.
> 
> We have benefitted greatly from having Clare as a member of our team and can wholeheartedly recommend her to you.
> 
> Should you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

_Elizabeth Cameron (Head of Music at Invicta Grammar School)_

> Clare's teaching has been encouraging and inspiring.  She knows how to choose the right songs for the right voice and personality; she has introduced students to less familiar composers and she helps them to sing the repertoire that interests them.  At my school her students have sung a huge range of songs from Mozart to musicals to Amy Winehouse to Tom Lehrer.  She has supported them preparing for recitals at the end of a course and and she has developed young voices with great musical sensitivity.  I would heartily recommend Clare's teaching to _everyone_ - wherever your musical tastes lie, Clare will help you to realise your singing dreams!

> The Capel Players are a group of amateur 'entertainers' based in North London.  We formed in 1984; and are a non-profit making group that has raised over £50,000 for local (to our Enfield/Cheshunt home) in the time we have been together staging shows, performing at functions and taking part in 'Singathons'.
> 
> We pride ourselves on being inclusive and members (who currently number 12) past and present cover the full range of age and ability. We meet weekly to rehearse and had on one previous occasion engaged the services of a professional singing teacher with the aim of improving our joint technique, with somewhat limited success.  Despite this one of our members who had been taking singing lessons with Clare and making impressive progress suggested that she (Clare) might be willing to take us on en masse for a day long group coaching session.  We were very pleased when Clare agreed and we travelled from Enfield to Kent in convoy on a Saturday in November remembering our previous experience of joint coaching and not quite knowing what to expect.
> 
> Clare had asked us to provide a brief summary outlining the experience and ability of each of the Capel Players in advance.  Even so we were very impressed to find that she had clearly prepared for and planned ahead for the day to optimise the benefits to us, breaking it up into a range of activities and working with us as a group and individually.
> 
> The day started with introductions all round and a series of exercises which proved both entertaining (at one point lying on our backs on the floor making noises akin to a passenger liner sailing into port!) and beneficial as it caused the more apprehensive amongst us to relax.
> 
> Clare then listened to each of us individually doing scales while she accompanied us on the keyboard, to get an understanding of our abilities.  She quickly and adeptly put everyone at their ease giving advice on technique and breathing as we went along.
> 
> She got us to sing some of our group numbers to her and made some valuable recommendations encouraging us to concentrate on introducing 'light and shade' into our performance and to move away from the 'karaoke' tendency.
> 
> She had prepared a number of songs to work on with us (and provided word-sheets that she had typed up in advance) including a very clever merging of two totally different songs that she got us to work on together.
> 
> By the end of the day we were unanimous that it had been a great success and that we had all learnt a great deal.  
> Clare's obvious musical knowledge and coaching skill gave us confidence and inspiration that we have put into practice at every opportunity since.  We are now planning our next trip to Kent for the next stage of our joint musical education.

_Olivia Waldron_

> Having always wanted singing lessons, I went to see Clare six months ago.  In that time, I am amazed - and immensely pleased - at how far I've come - both in technique and appreciation of music.  Clare's utterly instinctive when it comes to knowing what a pupil needs to do to improve; she has a clarity about the way that she explains everything, which makes it completely accessible (even to someone with very little background in music).  She is also the sort of teacher who acutally makes you want to work, and I find myself singing whatever piece I'm working on all day... I'm sure people must think I'm insane; either way, I always come out of lessons with a smile on my face!  I've recommended her to several of my friends, all of whom seem to be progressing and really enjoying lessons with her, too.

_Billie-Jo Findler_

> Having finally set a wedding date, I thought it'd be a great idea to do something a little different and sing at my own wedding, despite never having sung anywhere other than in the shower or car.  I did my research and came across Clare's website and immediately knew that she was the teacher for me.  At the first assessment I said that I wanted her to be truthful and tell me if the goal was achievable or not, as I didn't want to waste her time or my money.  That's exactly what she was and continued to do so throughout our journey.  Despite being married now for three years I still see Clare weekly.  I find the lessons a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.  The exercises are not easy by any stretch of the imagination but when you sing a song that you never imagined possible, it makes it all worthwhile.  Clare has a way of making you feel comfortable despite being out of your comfort zone; I've never left a lesson with any negativity, just a desire to constantly improve and impress Clare at the next lesson.  She really does know her stuff and I'd highly recommend her to anyone.

_Rachel Piper_

> Following a recommendation from a friend, I have been having singing lessons with Clare for around 18 months and have loved it.  During this time, my voice has been tweaked and adjusted to produce a stronger, more consistent sound.  My range has also been extended at both ends of the scale, which I'm very pleased about, and I hope to continue improving under Clare's tuition.  I have lost a lot of bad habits (and discovered a few more along the way!) and am very pleased with the progress that I have made.  I have also significantly improved my ability to read music, which is an added bonus.  I have been introduced to loads of great songs that I would never have discovered otherwise and Clare is excellent at finding songs that will suit your tastes, as well as being good teaching tools.  Clare is friendly and fun, we have a great laugh and I have very much enjoyed my singing lessons with Clare.  I'd be happy to recommend her to a friend...!

_Judy Tattersfield_

> Clare sang at our Golden Wedding in 2009 and wowed an audience of 70 guests.  One of our major interests has been choral and solo singing, and during the last decade or so Clare has been singing teacher to us both.  Clare is a gifted classically-trained singer who has recently added jazz to her range of techniques.  She is able to choose a programme for all tastes from the comic to the serious, and for the older generation as well as younger people.  She is also flexible as to the timing or length of her performance and considerate of how it will fit into the larger event.  Many of our guests were friends from our world of singing, and Clare's act received much appreciation and praise.  We can recommend her highly as an entertainer.

_Chantelle Jay_

> Having had little formal training as an adult and a love of amateur operatics I was extremely pleased to find Clare.  She has not only improved my singing techniques but also introduced me to other styles of singing and sight reading which were outside of my comfort zone, which has been extremely rewarding.  A very patient and conscientious tutor!

_Natalia Davis_

> Clare was recommended to me two years ago, and after a 'trial' lesson I knew that her approach would suit me very well.  She is both professional and great fun, and has the ability to communicate with her students in a way that they can understand and learn from.  Clare can cater for all abilities - I only sing for (my) pleasure and look forward to my lesson every week!

_Kevin Fitzsimons (Father of Megan)_

> My daughter Megan has been a student with Clare for just under a year.  From a girl with raw talent she has developed Megan into an accomplished singer.
> 
> Megan enjoys her singing lessons with Clare.  She said,"The lessons are fun," the way she talks about Clare it's obvious she has great respect for her.  From a girl approaching her teenage years; Clare must have a great gift...
> 
> I know from my own early years when I learned to play the piano the importance of finding a good music teacher; one who creates a friendly atmosphere and gives good feedback about your progress.
> 
> Megan has quickly built up a rapport with Clare, this I assume is down to Clare's professionalism and the way she makes Megan feel about her singing and her love of music.
> 
> I am very pleased that Clare is Megan's music teacher and I feel very lucky to have found her.  Whatever the future holds for my daughter I know that in my heart Megan will receive a great grounding in her singing and the joy of music.
