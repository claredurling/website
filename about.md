I am originally from Highcliffe in Dorset and have recently relocated back to my roots, but this time just over the border in New Milton, Hampshire.

My love of singing started at a very early age as a member of the Highcliffe Junior Choir under Mary Denniss.

In 1983 I gained a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and after completing the four year Performing Course, in 1989 I began the Opera Course.

During my time at the Guildhall, I was awarded the Sir George Frederick Painter Prize for Gilbert & Sullivan, the Herbert Murrell Chanson Prize, and the Guildhall Opera Prize. I was also twice winner of the mezzo-soprano class at the International Eisteddfod, Llangollen, Wales.

Before finishing the Opera Course, I began my first season at Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and l also sang with Glyndebourne Touring Opera and Scottish Opera. Later, I was a freelance singer with Oratorio and Opera work taking me all over the United Kingdom and Europe.

As well as specialising in classical singing, I also have a more recent background in jazz. After attending a Jazz Vocal Summer School in France, in 2005 I spent two years having lessons in London to further my technique, and latterly co-hosted an Open-Mic Jazz Night in the Music Room at Pizza Express, Maidstone.

I devote all my time and energy into teaching young people to sing. I am a dedicated teacher with the ability to teach classical, pop, and jazz vocal technique. I have considerable experience in exam preparation with excellent pupil success. My preferred teaching style is organised and hard-working, but always fun.
